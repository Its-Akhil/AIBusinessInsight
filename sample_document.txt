welcome to the first implementation call inside of the agency accelerator week now first four episodes I'm going to be honest with you I had to keep those a little bit more surface level a little bit more generalized the point of this week is to really show you what agency accelerator is about which is the most step-by-step agency training that's ever been made the three episodes you're going to get here inside of the implementation week are modules that are taken directly from the phases inside the program that really show you how to find clients sign them and keep them for as long as possible and make sure that they are over the moon with the service that you provide today's episode is with Gom Gom owns lemlist Which is a multi9 figure software now inside the program I could have brought on an Outreach expert or I could bring on the guy who owns the software that all the Outreach experts use to do their Outreach Gom gets to see the backend Outreach for over $100 million that was processed to lemlist last month alone he is the number one expert in the world when it comes to outreach and in today's module he's going to show you exactly how to create a successful campaign and he's going to show you how to do this through intent based campaigns which pretty much no one talks about and with this you're going to be able to turn cold prospects into paying clients for your Agency On Demand so with no further Ado let's get into [Music] it when I first got started with Co mailing I tested thousands of different Frameworks to understand what would work and not work I went from receiving this kind of reply to receiving this kind of email we're at the stage where you know how to build your personal brand so the people you reach out to will know that you're someone they can trust so now I'm going to show you how to convince them to have a meeting with you with the right called email in this video you will see that every well- written email that books meetings has a very clear structure that you can replicate and adapt for your Niche I'm going to show you the anatomy of a perfect email exclusive example and Frameworks of subject lines that give you good open and reply rates how to write a perfect pitch and how to write a clear call to action that opens conversation but before we dive into it let me tell you about the most important thing that defines your email success without it even the most perfect email that is written based on the best practice will go straight into the bin can you guess what it is the intent the intent is knowing when to send the right offer at the right time to the right type of customers let me give you an example back in the covid times when everyone was trying to get face masx we had a customer we reach out to their Prospect with the worst copyrighting of all time the subject line was need mask question mark and the email had no intro no fancy fit just a few line explaining that they have mask that they can can supply to offices so employees can use them just because the intent was so strong people couldn't work without mask their email got tons of positive responses and they generated millions of dollars when you choose the right intent you're destined to get a response from your prospect with the intent it also becomes easier to write your email choose your subject and personalize your pitch and the call to action and last but not least it helps you send your email at the right time I'm going to C those three main intents so you can get the overall idea how to use them the compan is hiring people changing their roles and the company is raising funds if a company is hiring it usually mean their process are going to change a bit since they are adding more people for example at LM list we pay attention to when sales team are hiring since we help these teams boost growth with Alman sales to use this tactic you can use LinkedIn sales Navigator account filters to find companies that have grown their sales team this is what the filter looks like on sales Navigator the second intent is when people change roles so for example if you see that someone you follow goes from SDR to manager or head off or director we say this is a good intent because generally when you start a new role you are looking to introduce new tools and new tactics to increase performance within your first night the date to do this there are a few things you can do follow these Targets on LinkedIn set post notification for them on LinkedIn the little bell their profile add them to a list on LinkedIn sales Navigator and activate notification when something changes the third intent is when a company raised funds recently if a company raises funds they obviously have some money to spend but this also mean that they will be trying to grow the company much faster you can also learn so much about their initiative this way since there are usually press releases and article that will state what they hope to do with the funding to find Target this way you can follow the company on LinkedIn plus turn on sales Navigators notification for the account or simply use crunch base to identify leads that have ronds recently or you can also do this manually by using Google news or through a Google search filtering by site like the screenshot below you can identify your own intent to use in your Niche using the same logic or go to LM templat library and see what other intents we also use another powerful intent is to reach out to people who interact with your LinkedIn content after all this is exactly why you're building your personal brand so let's have a look at this post about Tapo that I wrote a month ago this post had roughly 12200 people commenting or liking a post about the story of our company and why I believe that the future lies into a mix between personal brand and Outreach called the hybrid funnel so what I'm going to do is to extract all the people who commented and like they are the hottest leads then I'm going to find their emails using a mix of Lam list and Topo and start sending them a multi- channel campaign I will focus only on the first message to show you the power of intent you can now see it on your screen and this are some of the replies I received for the full demo of what I've just covered you will have Kevin who will show you how to do what I've just done step by step now why did it work so well the intent is perfect these people like to post and I just follow up the conversation already started on the platform where this so how much reach and traction I had the trust is established and the outbound part is all about closing the deals now you're probably thinking yeah but I won't get such a reach on LinkedIn at first that's true but you don't need it you see T who works in s in our team does the exact same approach but without the same reach at all it might only have 10 likes but it generated three qualified meetings and that's because you shouldn't only focus on likes and comments sure this is a good way to get the hottest did but there's a secret no one knows about on your sales Navigator account you can see who visited your profile in the last 90 days and that's the people you should reach out to you see most people in mingin are lurkers they see your content but never interact with it however they will go on your profile to check you out let me tell you a story back in 2018 I had a meeting with a head of sales of a us-based publicly traded company called dandes when we started talking I asked him how he knew about us and he told me that the only thing he could see on his LinkedIn was my content at the time I didn't have such a big audience nor a udri after looking at all my post for the last months I realized that not once he had liked or commented on my post but he was reading them this meant that I had built so much trust that the closing phase was a lot easier once you extract the list of people who visited your profile simply contact them mentioning the typical topics you discuss Kevin will show you how to do it in the demo now that you understand why it's important to reach a prospect with the right intent and how it impacts your chances of positive reply I'm going to show you how to write a good called email what structure to follow and what pitfalls to avoid so let's start by looking at this example this email has a generating intro fake flattery that I'm sure was generated to their entire campaign and the biggest problem of all completely irrelevant to my business the intent just isn't right when we launch a business or work for a company we get so caught up in what we do believing that it is unique and awesome that we forget the number one rule of any relationship if you truly want to be loved and remembered you should make it about them and not about you and if your emails currently look like this don't worry that's what we're here to fix now the ideal email contains an interesting subject line that Sparks attention a personalized intro line that connects to your audience followed by your pitch that is centered around value for your prospect and ends with a clear call to action let's look at this example the subject line is one word that isn't common for emails an instant spark of curiosity the intro so you've got a team of outburn SD is short and straight to the point but show that you've done your research then there's a bris list of struggle the prospect May struggle with which connects to the sales pitch the pitch clearly explain what's in it for the customers it's not self-centered at all and the open question calls for the continuation of the conversation and then there's a personalized message that resonates with the compan struggle of course there are some other things that you can add but this is the basic structure I will show you how you can create such emails in a few minutes after you find the intent you're going to Target you need to start with a subject line the first rule of a good subject line is to keep it personalized look at this two example which one will make a potential customer think that the email was written just for them the first example can be sent to anyone it's not personalized at all super generic while the second one when you mention your potential customer competitor show that your email is industry specific and was written specifically for them remember your LinkedIn books your email subject lines have the same purpose to stop your prospect from scrolling in the inbox look at the wording in the example in green I have an idea of how to boost your sales first first of all I makes it looks more human second it sounds conversational and much friendlier than a simple plain book sales Consulting meetings so keep your email subject line concise and straight to the point and show the value you bring notice how the second example has a company's name in it personalization is key so image subject line should not take up a lot of space readers should click after one look we've Tred different lens and here are the results we've received as you can see the shorter the sub line the higher the chance that the prospect will open it now let's talk about the cold email subject line that had the lowest success rate of our analysis your video will be deleted in three days do you notice how spammy it sounds the next one is first name special 25% off coupon this one sounds like a scam and it's not specific enough 20% of what and why is it helpful to your prospect what is your request so let's move on to the next one launching your own nft Marketplace has never been easier this sub decline is too long and again it's not specific enough why would this Prospect want an nft Marketplace how is it easier next is 90% of companies are struggling with hiring developers see why this subject line is too long and looks like the title of listicle instead of a helpful email plus imagine your prospect looking at it on their phones half of the text won't be shown next we have at now first name this offer will expire you can already tell that it's pushy and too salesy it also includes trigger words like act now that can get your email marked to spam I've prepared for you a list of trigger words to avoid so your subject lines don't come off spaning like congratulations 100% free no fees win make money limited time act now call now EUR a winner not spam etc etc etc so you'll be able to access all that list directly in no now let's talk a bit more in detail about personalization many people and myself included in the beginning think that just by adding a compat his name to a subject line it will be personalized this is not how it actually works and to prove it we've analyzed hundreds of thousands of lless campaigns meaning hundreds of millions of email just having you or first name in the subject line didn't make a notable difference so what does that mean you'll have to take your personalization a step further than adding basic keywords here are two ways that you can do that the first one is to try more specific variables than just first name personalize your subject line with custom variable like penpoint competitor common ground or objective with LM list you can automatically personalize your subject line and messages and Kevin from my team will cover it in his demo another way to personalize your subject line is to ask your prospect a question if it's relevant traditionally people believe that is good way to speak curiosity and engage a prospect in a discussion but our data shows that it's not necessarily true as you can see from this chart adding a question to your B2B called email subject won't guarantee success and if you try to over optimize by adding multiple question marks this will hurt your open rate so how should you use questions in the subject lens first of all be specific ask a question that addresses the prospect specific pinpoint example need help with penpoint or need help with growing on LinkedIn Second Challenge your expectations provoke a response by surprising them happy with 50% operate question mark now let's look at 10 good subject lines and why they work this subject line all got 80 plus% open rates and were sent at least 50 times subject line one love your last article why this subject line works it's short simple and personal the email was sent within days of the prospect publishing content that align with the sender value proposition it focuses on the Prospect and it's personal without overusing personalization buzzword how can you use it well you can reach out to your prospect based on specific timing triggers congratulate them on recent work or achievements instead of just selling your product immediately this is also a great subject line for networking subject line number two last call first name closing soon why this subject line works because it adds urgency and Intrigue this example came from a followup email so the lead already have context for the offer that was ending with this subject line the lead is incentivized to act quickly open the email and respond a subject line like this is best choed as a second or third contact when the lead already has an idea of the value you're offering so use it as a push to get them to act in a short time frame once you've already warmed them up subject line number three little surprise for you first name why does this subject line work well it's expressive Evol curiosity and offers something to the prospect in a friendly and Casual way how to use it use a subject line like this when you are sure there's value added to your message match it with a helpful resource a referral or a free trial that addresses your prospect specific needs for example here's a little surprise for you Peter I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive link to try out our premium features the subject line number four is collaboration with domain this subject is short simple straight to the point the prospect knows exactly what is being offered and how they can act on it so use a subject line like this when your prospect is already familiar with your domain or branding include social proof in your message otherwise the offer of a collaboration will not be enough you can do this by connecting J LinkedIn first or if you have already interacted with this Prospect online or in person for example collaboration with lemlist after a conversation on LinkedIn the other day I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity of shooting you an email to make this happen subject line number five first name how about we have a chat this subject line is casual and friendly it doesn't ask too much from the Prospect and present also a clear action just a quick chat P this subject line with an email that offers a clear benefit to the prospect for having a chat with you so deliver value immediately so that your prospect is urged to take time out of their schedule for a call with you for example Peter are you up for a chat I've been reading your L article and S of a couple of ways to help you continue to grow your business I'd love to discuss them with you subject line number six ideas for paino the subject line addresses a prospect paino and offers actionable solution this one calls for an in-depth research upfront in order to understand the different pain points the pain point should be narrow and specific to your prospect that's why you should always keep a list of the pain points you identify while telling your customers and doing research through different communities so subject line number seven question about company culture at company name this one Spar the prospect interest without selling anything this subject line was used by a nature SAS company so the company culture topic transition easily into its core offering so swap out company culture for a detail that is more specific to your prospect and product turn your question into your email first line or book your prospect should see the subject line and first line in the preview and know immediately what you are asking asking for example how did LM begin its International expansion was wondering what tactic L used to expand the company internationally etc etc next subject line is idas and feedback for you and company name companies are always looking for customer feedback to make their products and services better this offers some genuine user feedback which a centered transition into discussion of how they could help the company with the specific needs that they have to use it effectively give the business legitim an actionable feedback in your message add details that are relevant to them and again do some research ahead of time for example improve graphic design to attract attention after taking a look at your website found that you got some great content but graphing design could use a bit of a boost subject line number nine is hey first name congrats on your funding ground this one is timely and specific this was sent by a salesperson offering a product for sales team so the funding R meant resource is for the startup to scale their in find a specific trigger that relates to your product like funding round just started a new job IPO Etc and congratulate your prospect then offer a resource call or ID that is valuable to them at this specific moment for example hey Peter congrats on your funding ground I was impressed to learn about your latest achievements we could set up a coffee date to discuss how you can keep the B rolling and the last subject line is build company name like Comm Comm interest this is a strong one because it's targeted and builds for more you already know the prospect is interested in command interest and they don't want to miss out on building their business again you will need to do a bit of research to find the common interest between yourself and your prospect it could be an entrepreneur Mutual connection or even a sports team as long as it's relevant and it SPS interest for example LM list will win more trophies than Messi you can test different subject line to see which one work best with AB testing like this you will have your own data and a better understanding of your customers try two variation of the same subject line so for example subject line with or without emojis send one variation to 50% of your audience and the second variation to the other 50% make sure that there are enough people in the email list for the results to be relevant statistically aim for 100 to 200 people and once that's done you can compare the open rates and reply rate for each subject line you learn which techniques your audience respond best to a good subject line is onethird of the determination of whether you will receive a response from your prospect so it's okay to dedicate some time to practicing it subject lines are vital to your campaign because they are one of the first thing that your lead will see along with your name and intro line but that bring us to the next part your intro line if the subject line contain only a couple of words it means that parts of your intro line will also be seen in the inbox that's why it's important to mention important things in the subject straight away and don't make your intro line feel like a let down like your subject line you want to make your intro line as eye-catching and interesting as possible this will be the key to ensuring the rest of your email is read it is also way too common for us to wave the intro line focusing on ourselves instead of on your lead you might be saying but G how will they know who I am and what I'm doing I can assure you that they will find out this information later the goal of the intro line is not to introduce yourself but to show them how you have gotten to know them however if you leave the intro line about yourself the chances of your lead getting to the value proposition are very very low in this example the intro is very generated the idea is to move from this kind of introduction to highly personalized ones that are captivating the best inos are value based so this is when you stage right away why you're reaching out and how you can help you promise to either solve a problem boost efficiency or refer gamechanging info without any string detached start Strong by showing what's in it for them to ignite a conversation once they engage you've got the green light to pursue them for example I've got a hack to slash your content production by half so make it about them not about you look at these two intros the first one jump straight into setting the second one shows that you've done your research and understand your prospect so a great intro is also when you complement their achievements so here a prospect shared a post about their latest companies's win since lire is on the same gross pass I use the company's news to build my intro line in addition to a company's Milestone you can also use the opening line to celebrate someone's promotion this creates an even more personal connection between you and the reader as it shows you're not only following the company news but also their progress as an individual here's how a member of our team use this kind of opening line to connect with a prospect you can also start by showing that you understand your prospect needs and struggles based on the content they share so look at these two example the left one doesn't show that you've done any research it's saly and very self-centered the right one addresses the right struggle and suggests that you are going to propose a good solution to it another great way to start your email is to show that you share the same opinion as your prospect this create an emotional connection and increases the chance that they will be hooked and keep reading as you can see it requires a bit of research but that's what it takes to stand out so you can leverage what you've learned about your prospect when following your intro with real concrete feedback on the company it should tie into the offer you have for them and position you as an expert on the subject here on your screen is an example of a successful email that use this opening line for a powerful opening line that allows your prospect to imagine a clear business results give this one a try it delivers value right off the bat with an exciting metric that the prospect could attain if they respond to your email mentioning a team member manager or CEO of the company they work for makes it even more personalized another intro line that makes good use of social media this one calls out someone's recent activity and connects your pitch with their need for example if you're part of the same Facebook Community or Forum as a prospect that shows that you share mutual interest if you then reference the specific pox or comments that the prospect made you're building the relationship so here's one way you can use it now if you follow up on your prospect based on the interaction you've already had you can use the intro as promise dot dot dot for example T uses this intro when sending his guide to people who engage with linked post if your prospect attended one of your events for example like a webinar you can send them a followup with this intro yesterday you attended my webinar about specific topic as you may have noticed I already showed you several example with personalized pictures this is by far one of the most powerful tactics for getting your prospect attention and Kevin will show you how to make them step by step in the lambist demo it takes just a few clicks now that we've established the foundation with the email structure subject line and introdu is time to discuss the meth of your email the pitch this is a part where you tell your prospect what your service is about and how exactly you will deliver value to them so let's stop for a bit on the second part how exactly you will deliver value to them this is the key since the very beginning of the course I've mentioned that you should obsess over your customer's problem create the service for them and show them what's in it for them so look at the pitch in this example Can you spot what's wrong with it you can pause the video and have a close look at it and take your guess and I will tell you the answer in a few seconds now let's see there's a lot of talk about a company and their achievement no mention of the prospect pinpoint as the only focus was to talk about their service no personalization which shows the email was probably sent to hundreds of thousands of people overall is very self-centered so how to get in touch with your prospect by making the Emil about them and not about you let's look at this example the pitch focuses on the prospect struggle and the need for automated enrichment of the accounts it tends to create a relationship not sell it also creates an emotional connection because it mention that we know how much time it takes to do this task manually another mistake to avoid is focusing on too many pain points I know you've done your research in the past and now understand your prospect really well but remember the golden rule of focusing on the most important problem this applies to your C email to take a look at the pitch in this email why this C email won't get many replies first of all it contains a bullet list of different business activities which can be confusing for the prospect as they won't be sure what the company's speciality is there is no clear value proposed and the prospect might get lost in all the info searching for it and because there's no clear personalized paino the email might seem robotic so let's see the better version this email under the exact pain points that the prospect is currently facing which will make them relate more easily it also makes the value very obvious so they have a reason to reply it also include numbers as social proof to build more credibility everything you have to offer might be impressive for you however your prospect would care more about a specific service or product solving their specific paino the more you show your prospect you understand their struggle the easier it is to tease them with a solution with bring ree more replied another Golden Rule for succeeding in your Outreach is to talk in your audien's language knowing the in and out of your industry makes you assume that everyone understand what you're talking about which isn't always the case that's why you should always adjust your writing when reaching out to people so here's what you don't want your email to sound like as you can see there are industry words such as da Dr and AdSense that aren't familiar to all prospects because of the jargon the message sounds very formal and cool it also seems very generic so it's hard to understand the possible outcome of the service with the publication of any of this website increase my traffic if yes by how much so here's a good example for you what are the good practices to adopt from here this email uses a language that the reader speaks on a day-to-day basis not exclusively at work it includes useful link that clarify to the prospect what they're talking about leaving no room for self-interpreting context it sound like they talk face Toof face to a prospect which Mak it less generic and a lot more personal in your C emails your goal should not be to sound smarter but to sound more human and very clear company's job ads are an extremely underrated source of information for your Peach the take this needle out of my back strategy uses this Tri it shows that you understand their needs and are ready to help solve their problems Lucas reached to his Prospect offering to boost their outon Channel by offering during sales meeting as a service he leverages the job post that he saw from this company in his email I saw your hiring for a sales position on Angel list and I was wondering if this is something that I could help you with then Lucas goes in for the kill in his speech by proving how he was created success for his client in the past complete with real example of companies they have been able to get in touch with and help for example T did something similar to this reaching out to entrepreneurs with a pitch to show them how he can boost their content effort he was very clear about exactly what services he offered and much just with his client's needs another way to boost your reply rate is to include all the important information in your first email Roxana did this when reaching out to bloggers aiming to offer guest post and become a contributor she eliminated back and force email by simply doing the work in advance so all they have to do is respond if they are in I'm reaching out because I wanted to contribute to creating some fire content for your website one of our favorites is the 100 personalization method for example I use this technique when reaching out to an entrepreneur I wanted to network with your lead will love getting emails like this because let's face it who doesn't like something that is specifically made for them Kevin will show you how to create your own personalized images and you will see it's super easy and fun okay so now when you have the examples and tactics laid out how can you apply them I like to use what called the push pull technique so let's break it down a bit you first start with a strong ask like the one in this example actionable talk no fluff that's a promise and then at the end of your email you pull away by writing if you're too busy I'll understand either way keep working the idea here is not to be too pushy and demanding now what's left to finish up your Cod emails with the right CTA so your prospect can book a meeting directly with you the most popular ctas which we all use at some point are bua demo or bu the problem with them is they aren't really personalized do you remember that personalization should be your first priority so your customer got the feeling that you've created your services just for them well your CTA should follow the same principle the best ctas provide value they don't ask for 15 or 30 or 45 minutes of your time here's an example of the email with a value based CTA that T from our team sent to his Prospect as you can see the CTA could I share a template that's getting 50 plus meetings per week suggest a solution to the prospect problem which is low email responses we know it works well because here are the response that received if you offer copyrighting services your ctas can be can I send you the ultimate content framework that helps me generate 50 content ideas under 15 minutes that's why you need to understand your prospect struggle so your CTA can address them avoid sending a link to an hourong webinar that you've done the topic as well as inserting some 100 page studies you conducted your prospects don't want them they want a solution to their problems overall goodl magnets get five to 10 times more replies than standard email so now you should really need to have a meeting you also need to make your prospect life easier don't ask them if 5:00 p.m next week Works instead inserts your CV or lmal link so people can pick the convenience SCE themselves you can and you should personalize your closing line that's where liquid syntax come into play you're probably thinking G what is this again but wait don't be scared it's a technique that brings your Cod demand personalization to the next level liquid syntax will also save you a lot of time down the road too it's way easier than it may seem it basically allows you to personalize your email based on specific criteria so for example when you have leads with different position within the same campaign and you want to mention a different paino depending on if they are like head of sales or SDR or bdr well you'll be able since to liquid syntax to personalize emails at scale for all your needs and it works as an easy code Builder with condition like if this or this then do that or that so like if it's a founder and this Tex if it's an SDR and this version Etc of course when you start playing with it you can do so many more cool stuff for example you can split your email list into three segments and divide them into buckets let's say this three segments are agencies sales teams and startups so each of them can have a different closing that is most relevant to them here's how you can do it too add a segmentation column to your CSV file just like this one then write different closing lines for each segments then go on LM list create an email and click on add a custom variable and then choose add liquid syntax the liquistic tabs will then separate different segments automatically like this but Kevin will show you how to work with liquid syntax B on the prospect job title the language they speak and the time your email sent in a demo of LM list a bit later while they may not get as much attention as subject lines your email closing lines or ctas are just as important in writing an effective C email they are the final push to convince your prospect to take action and since your goal is to make your prospect go to the next step here are the most important key takeaways to remember be short clear and concise create a smooth transition between the pitch and signature get prospects excited about the next step use personalization to stand outs includes zero friction so make your prospect life easier and always try to build relationships before trying to sell now that you understand what it takes to write a perfect code email that gets replies let's move on to setting your multi- channel sequences for maximum results see you in next part peace so the next few days are going to feel like Christmas this was just the first of three implementation classes that
