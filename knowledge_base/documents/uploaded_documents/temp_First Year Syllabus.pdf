can generate more problems than solutions.  
8. Define the principles and ideals, which help in making the judgement of 
what is more important.  
9.  See that ‘I’ and ‘Body’ are two realities, and most of their desires are 
related to ‘I’ and no t body, while their efforts are mostly centered on the 
fulfilment of the needs of the body assuming that it will meet the needs 
of ‘I’ too.  
10. Appreciate the importance of harmony in the self, family and the society 
for mutual fulfilment.

Description  The course takes the learnings from the previous semester to an 
advanced level of language learning and self -comprehension through 
the introduction of audio -visual aids as language enablers. It also leads 
learners to an advanced level of writing, reading, listening and 
speaking abilities, while also reducing the usage of L1 to minimal in 
order to increase the employability chances.
